            <p>Have you seen the ridiculously cheap airfare to Europe right now? Thanks to Scott’s Cheap Flights (now
                called Going), I’ve found roundtrip fares from the U.S. for around $250, and intra-European flights for
                as low as $10. I haven’t seen flight deals like this since before the pandemic!

                However, while the flights to Europe may be cheap, the bigger expenses don’t kick in until after you
                arrive. Once you hop off the plane, your hard-earned money will be spent on hotels, meals, and tourist
                attractions. The price of airfare pales in comparison.

                For a moment, let’s forget about the popular cities of London and Paris, and instead look to Europe’s
                lesser-known hidden gems. I’m not just talking about eastern Europe; there are many reasonably-priced
                cities across western and central Europe, too. I’ve done my best to highlight them below.</p><br><br>

                cities in Europe you should visit in 2023!</h5><br><br>

                    <p>   Looking for cheap places to visit in Europe? Before jumping into all the best cities to explore, I want to share a quick tip to save money on the airfare.
                    
                    For the past 3 years, I’ve used Scott’s Cheap Flights (now called Going) to find unbeatable flight deals. This FREE email service is super easy to use. All you have to do is enter your home airport and where you want to go, and they’ll send you mistake fares and other amazing deals. In 2022 alone, I saved thousands of dollars thanks to their email alerts – including most recently, a $237 roundtrip fare from Boston to Norway. On average, I save about $300 roundtrip on selected flight routes. So, trust me when I say that Scott’s is the way to go!
                    
                    In addition to the free version, Scotts’s Cheap Flights also offers a premium membership. If you’re a frequent traveler like me, it’s definitely worth the upgrade for $49 per year. I recommend trying the free trial and if you find it valuable (like I do), be sure to use my discount code JON20 to save 20%!
